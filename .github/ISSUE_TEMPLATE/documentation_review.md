## Description

Despite our best intentions, documentation frequently becomes outdated or incomplete. This ticket should be created periodically and act as a reminder to review these concerns.

## Tasks

- [ ] Review the README for accuracy and completeness.
    - If the README is very long, consider limiting this task to a specific section or group of sections.
- [ ] Review all `@todo` statements in the codebase and resolve them or ensure that tickets are created for them.
- [ ] Review Dependabot and GitHub config to ensure the correct usernames/labels/etc are being used.
